# This project includes using the Hardhat framework to create a simple storage contract that is able to connect to both local hardhat blockchain as well as ethereum testnets (Goerli).
The contract has features that allows users to:
1. Store a favorite number
2. Retrieve a favorite number
3. Store an array of person and their favorite number

Some basic tests were also included to ensure coverage of our contract and that the functionalities work as intended.
