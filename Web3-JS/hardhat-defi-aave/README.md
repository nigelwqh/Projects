# This project interacts with the Aave protocol to utilize some of its Defi capabilities.
The contract has features that allows users to programmatically:
1. Convert ETH to WETH (Wrapped Ethereum) in order to interact with Dapps on the Ethereum blockchain
2. Deposit some WETH as collateral into Aave
3. Borrow some DAI on Aave using the WETH we have deposited as collateral
4. Repay the DAI borrowed
