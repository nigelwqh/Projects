# This project includes creating a fund me smart contract that is able to connect to both local hardhat blockchain as well as ethereum testnets (Goerli).
The contract has features that allows users to:
1. Fund the contract with ether
2. Withdraw ether from the contract
3. View the funders
4. View how much ethers each funder has funded

Some basic tests were also included to ensure coverage of our contract and that the functionalities work as intended.
